# leapfrog
Welcome to our CSC Sample Game!
LeapFrog is a pygame developed by Shivansh Patel and Anshul Rao from 8/5/21 - 8/12/21. 
LeapFrog is meant to represent an intermediate level project and was made with python using the pygame module. 
The game features a frog player character which is controllable through left and right movement by either W and D or the Left and Right Arrow Keys.
The player's goal is to collect and jump from as many flies as possible to increase their score and fly count. 
Touching the flies will cause the frog to bounce and the fly to relocate which will increase the score.
